# Roll_A_Ball

Unity 5.3.1f1

Notes:
- skyboxes and textures are from the assets store

- music and other sound are either form Super Smash Bros. or Sonic Generations.

- there is a abb.inFinite()-something error. Ignore it. I figured out that it has something to do
  with the particle system and is a unity bug. Unfortunately there are now no particles in the
  build version. There is a workaround but it was just a dirty solution and the particles are not
  essential for the game.

- the controles are self-explanatory. WASD + Spacebar 

- Attention! The ball gets continuosly faster when you hold W down. And it can happen that he starts to jump
  because of the gravity - unity bug. Even with help of the others there where no solution.

- same about the camera. when it doesn´t turns as it should be, just jump another time carefully. Then it works.

HAVE FUN!
